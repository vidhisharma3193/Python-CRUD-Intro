# Python Intro

We are going to use these things to build a running API.

*  Python

*  Flask web framework

*  SQLite3

* SQLAlchemy

Now we are going to build a flask app that serves this data as a REST API.

```python
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv rest-api
$ source rest-api/bin/activate
$ mkdir rest-app
$ cd rest-app
```
Now we are in the main folder of app.Create a file called app.py in that folder.We need few libraries to finish our task.Install them by typing below commands.

```python
$ pip install flask
$ pip install sqlalchemy
```

run as:

```python
$ python app.py
```
